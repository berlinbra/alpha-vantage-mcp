# Alpha Vantage API Calls for Mean Reversion Trading Strategy

Based on the provided checklist for a mean reversion trading strategy, here are the recommended Alpha Vantage API endpoints that would be valuable to implement in the MCP server.

## Market Condition Analysis

### 1. CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) Trend
- **Endpoint**: `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`
- **Symbol**: `^VIX`
- **Purpose**: Track VIX trends over multiple days to identify declining volatility, which is favorable for mean reversion strategies
- **Implementation**: Calculate 2+ day VIX trend to confirm decreasing volatility

### 2. Sector Performance
- **Endpoint**: `SECTOR`
- **Purpose**: Identify sectors with positive relative strength
- **Implementation**: Compare sector performance to benchmark S&P 500

### 3. Market Trend
- **Endpoint**: `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`
- **Symbol**: `^GSPC` (S&P 500)
- **Purpose**: Confirm S&P 500 is above its 20-day moving average for a bullish backdrop
- **Implementation**: Calculate 20-day moving average and compare to current price

## Asset-Specific Technical Setup

### 4. Technical Indicators for Mean Reversion
- **Endpoint**: `BBANDS` (Bollinger Bands)
- **Purpose**: Identify movements â‰¥2 standard deviations from the 20-day mean
- **Implementation**: Configure with 20-day period and 2 standard deviations

### 5. Volume Analysis
- **Endpoint**: `TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY`
- **Purpose**: Detect volume climax (>150% of 10-day average)
- **Implementation**: Calculate 10-day average volume and compare to current volume

### 6. RSI(2) Indicator
- **Endpoint**: `RSI`
- **Purpose**: Identify oversold/overbought conditions (RSI < 10 for oversold)
- **Implementation**: Configure with 2-period setting for short-term signals

## Momentum Confirmation

### 7. Rate of Change Indicator
- **Endpoint**: `ROC` (Rate of Change)
- **Purpose**: Check for extreme percentile movements in price
- **Implementation**: Calculate 3-day ROC and determine percentile ranking

### 8. VWAP Analysis
- **Endpoint**: `VWAP` (Volume Weighted Average Price)
- **Purpose**: Identify price crossing back toward VWAP after deviation
- **Implementation**: Compare current price to VWAP for entry signals

### 9. ATR Analysis
- **Endpoint**: `ATR` (Average True Range)
- **Purpose**: Measure volatility (>120% of 20-day average indicates increased volatility)
- **Implementation**: Calculate 20-day average ATR and compare to current ATR

## Institutional Activity Signals

### 10. Options Volume and Open Interest
- **Endpoint**: `HISTORICAL_OPTIONS`
- **Purpose**: Identify unusual options activity and call/put imbalances
- **Implementation**: Calculate put/call ratio and compare to historical averages

## Risk Management & Analysis

### 11. SMA Indicators
- **Endpoint**: `SMA` (Simple Moving Average)
- **Purpose**: Calculate various moving averages (5, 10, 20, 50, 200 days)
- **Implementation**: Compare price to moving averages for trend confirmation

### 12. Volatility Ratio
- **Endpoint**: Custom calculation using `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`
- **Purpose**: Ensure not entering during extreme market conditions
- **Implementation**: Calculate ratio of current volatility to historical volatility

## Additional Tools for Enhanced Analysis

### 13. Correlation Analysis
- **Endpoint**: Custom calculation using `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`
- **Purpose**: Check correlation between target asset and broad market indices
- **Implementation**: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient

### 14. Intraday Momentum
- **Endpoint**: `TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY`
- **Parameters**: `interval=5min` or `interval=15min`
- **Purpose**: Identify first pullback after establishing a trend
- **Implementation**: Analyze intraday price patterns

### 15. Market Regime Filter
- **Endpoint**: `ADX` (Average Directional Index)
- **Purpose**: Determine if market is trending or range-bound
- **Implementation**: ADX < 20 indicates range-bound market (better for mean reversion)

## Implementation Recommendations

1. Create new tools in the MCP server for each of these API endpoints
2. Develop a composite tool that combines multiple indicators for a complete mean reversion signal
3. Add analysis capabilities to process raw data and provide actionable insights
4. Implement backtesting functionality to validate strategy parameters

These API calls and implementation recommendations would provide a comprehensive toolkit for executing the mean reversion strategy outlined in the checklist.
